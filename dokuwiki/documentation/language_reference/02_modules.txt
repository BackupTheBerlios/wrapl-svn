===== Modules =====
Wrapl is based on the [[Documentation:Riva]] module system, which allows modules to be loaded and identifiers exported from one module to be imported into other modules.The Wrapl loader loads each Wrapl source file as a single module. A module consists of any number of [[.03_declarations]] and [[.05_expressions]]. Identifiers declared as exported are accessible from outside the module. An identifier is declared as exported by using an exclamation mark in its declaration.
<code wrapl>
MOD ModuleName;

VAR ExportedVariable!;
DEF ExportedConstant! <- 100;

VAR NonExportedVariable;
DEF NonExportedConstant <- 100;

END ModuleName.
