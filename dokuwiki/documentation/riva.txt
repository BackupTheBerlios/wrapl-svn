====== Riva ======
Riva is the module loader which forms the base of the current implementation of Wrapl. Running ''riva ''//module// recursively loads //module// as well as any modules it depends on and executes //module's// code. Riva is capable of loaded several types of modules at the moment, but it is highly extendible allowing new loaders to be added easily.

The custom [[.Riva:Formats#riva]] binary format is a modular, relocatable binary format designed to ease the interface between Wrapl modules and native shared libraries. The linker ''rlink'' links object files generated by [[:Links#GCC]] along with import/export information files into a single [[.Riva:Formats#riva]] module.
