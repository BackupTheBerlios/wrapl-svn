  GooCanvasGroupModel represents a group of items. Groups can be nested to any depth, to create a
  hierarchy of items. Items are ordered within each group, with later items being displayed above
  earlier items.
  GooCanvasGroupModel is a subclass of GooCanvasItemModelSimple and so inherits all of the style
  properties such as "stroke-color", "fill-color" and "line-width". Setting a style property on a
  GooCanvasGroupModel will affect all children of the GooCanvasGroupModel (unless the children
  override the property setting).
  GooCanvasGroupModel implements the GooCanvasItemModel interface, so you can use the
  GooCanvasItemModel functions such as goo_canvas_item_model_raise() and goo_canvas_item_model_rotate
  (), and the properties such as "visibility" and "pointer-events".
  To create a GooCanvasGroupModel use goo_canvas_group_model_new().
  To get or set the properties of an existing GooCanvasGroupModel, use g_object_get() and g_object_set
  ().
  To respond to events such as mouse clicks on the group you must connect to the signal handlers of
  the corresponding GooCanvasGroup objects. (See goo_canvas_get_item() and "item-created".)

==== New ====
''New(parent : [[..:..:Gtk:GooCanvas:ItemModel#T|Gtk.GooCanvas.ItemModel.T]], __etc__ : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]) : [[# T| T]]''

  Creates a new group item.
  
  parent :  the parent model, or NULL. If a parent is specified, it will assume ownership of the item, and the item will
            automatically be freed when it is removed from the parent. Otherwise call g_object_unref() to free it.
  ... :     optional pairs of property names and values, and a terminating NULL.
  Returns : a new group model.
