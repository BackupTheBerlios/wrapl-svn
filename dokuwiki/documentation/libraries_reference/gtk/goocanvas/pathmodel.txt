  GooCanvasPathModel represents a model for path items, which are a series of one or more lines, bezier curves, or elliptical arcs.
  It is a subclass of GooCanvasItemModelSimple and so inherits all of the style properties such as "stroke-color", "fill-color" and "line-width".
  It also implements the GooCanvasItemModel interface, so you can use the GooCanvasItemModel functions such as goo_canvas_item_model_raise() and goo_canvas_item_model_rotate().
  GooCanvasPathModel uses the same path specification strings as the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) path element. For details see the SVG specification.
  To create a GooCanvasPathModel use goo_canvas_path_model_new().
  To get or set the properties of an existing GooCanvasPathModel, use g_object_get() and g_object_set().
  To respond to events such as mouse clicks on the path you must connect to the signal handlers of the corresponding GooCanvasPath objects. (See goo_canvas_get_item() and "item-created".)

''New(parent : [[..:..:Gtk:GooCanvas:ItemModel#T|Gtk.GooCanvas.ItemModel.T]], path_data : [[..:..:Std:String#T|Std.String.T]], __etc__ : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]) : [[# T| T]]''

  Creates a new path model.
  
  parent :    the parent model, or NULL. If a parent is specified, it will assume ownership of the item, and the item will automatically be freed when it is removed from the parent. Otherwise call g_object_unref() to free it.
  path_data : the sequence of path commands, specified as a string using the same syntax as in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) path element.
  ... :       optional pairs of property names and values, and a terminating NULL.
  Returns :   a new path model.
