  GooCanvasTableModel is a model for a table container used to lay out other canvas items. It is used in a similar way to how the GtkTable widget is used to lay out GTK+ widgets.
  Item models are added to the table using the normal methods, then goo_canvas_item_model_set_child_properties() is used to specify how each child item is to be positioned within the table (i.e. which row and column it is in, how much padding it should have and whether it should expand or shrink).
  GooCanvasTableModel is a subclass of GooCanvasItemModelSimple and so inherits all of the style properties such as "stroke-color", "fill-color" and "line-width". Setting a style property on a GooCanvasTableModel will affect all children of the GooCanvasTableModel (unless the children override the property setting).
  GooCanvasTableModel implements the GooCanvasItemModel interface, so you can use the GooCanvasItemModel functions such as goo_canvas_item_model_raise() and goo_canvas_item_rotate(), and the properties such as "visibility" and "pointer-events".
  To create a GooCanvasTableModel use goo_canvas_table_model_new().
  To get or set the properties of an existing GooCanvasTableModel, use g_object_get() and g_object_set().
  

==== :TableData ====
'':TableData(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Gtk:GooCanvas:TableData#T|Gtk.GooCanvas.TableData.T]]''


==== New ====
''New(parent : [[..:..:Gtk:GooCanvas:ItemModel#T|Gtk.GooCanvas.ItemModel.T]], __etc__ : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]) : [[# T| T]]''

  Creates a new table model.
  
  parent :  the parent model, or NULL. If a parent is specified, it will assume ownership of the item, and the item will automatically be freed when it is removed from the parent. Otherwise call g_object_unref() to free it.
  ... :     optional pairs of property names and values, and a terminating NULL.
  Returns : a new table model.
  

==== GetType ====
''GetType() : [[..:..:Gtk:GObject:Type#T|Gtk.GObject.Type.T]]''
