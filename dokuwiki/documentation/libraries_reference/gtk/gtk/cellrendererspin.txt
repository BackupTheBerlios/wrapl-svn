  GtkCellRendererSpin renders text in a cell like GtkCellRendererText from which
  it is derived. But while GtkCellRendererText offers a simple entry to edit the
  text, GtkCellRendererSpin offers a GtkSpinButton widget. Of course, that means
  that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.
  The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the cell
  renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the tree model,
  like all properties of cell renders. GtkCellRendererSpin also has properties
  for the climb rate and the number of digits to display. Other GtkSpinButton
  properties can be set in a handler for the start-editing signal.
  The GtkCellRendererSpin cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.
