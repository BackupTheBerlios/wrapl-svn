  You may wish to begin by reading the text widget conceptual overview which gives an overview of all
  the objects and data types related to the text widget and how they work together.
  A GtkTextMark is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in the text. You can
  convert the mark to an iterator using gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_mark(). Unlike iterators, marks
  remain valid across buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or
  deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the position originally
  occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a mark, a mark with left gravity will be
  moved to the beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with right gravity will be moved to
  the end. [3]
  Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the validity of the memory; marks
  can be deleted from the buffer at any time with gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark(). Once deleted from the
  buffer, a mark is essentially useless.
  Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the GtkTextMark object around.
  Marks are typically created using the gtk_text_buffer_create_mark() function.
  

==== :SetVisible ====
'':SetVisible(self @ [[#T|T]], setting @ [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

  Sets the visibility of mark; the insertion point is normally visible, i.e. you can see it as a vertical bar. Also, the
  text widget uses a visible mark to indicate where a drop will occur when dragging-and-dropping text. Most other marks
  are not visible. Marks are not visible by default.
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  setting : visibility of mark
  

==== :GetVisible ====
'':GetVisible(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]''

  Returns TRUE if the mark is visible (i.e. a cursor is displayed for it).
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  Returns : TRUE if visible
  

==== :Segment ====
'':Segment(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Address#T|Std.Address.T]]''


==== :GetBuffer ====
'':GetBuffer(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Gtk:Gtk:TextBuffer#T|Gtk.Gtk.TextBuffer.T]]''

  Gets the buffer this mark is located inside, or NULL if the mark is deleted.
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  Returns : the mark's GtkTextBuffer
  

==== :GetDeleted ====
'':GetDeleted(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]''

  Returns TRUE if the mark has been removed from its buffer with gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark(). See
  gtk_text_buffer_add_mark() for a way to add it to a buffer again.
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  Returns : whether the mark is deleted
  

==== :GetLeftGravity ====
'':GetLeftGravity(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]''

  Determines whether the mark has left gravity.
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  Returns : TRUE if the mark has left gravity, FALSE otherwise
  

==== :GetName ====
'':GetName(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:String#T|Std.String.T]]''

  Returns the mark name; returns NULL for anonymous marks.
  
  mark :    a GtkTextMark
  Returns : mark name
  

==== New ====
''New(name : [[..:..:Std:String#T|Std.String.T]], left_gravity : [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]) : [[# T| T]]''

  Creates a text mark. Add it to a buffer using gtk_text_buffer_add_mark(). If name is NULL, the mark is anonymous;
  otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name using gtk_text_buffer_get_mark(). If a mark has left gravity, and text is
  inserted at the mark's current location, the mark will be moved to the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has
  right gravity (left_gravity = FALSE), the mark will end up on the right of newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-
  right cursor is a mark with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right side of the text you're typing).
  
  name :         mark name or NULL
  left_gravity : whether the mark should have left gravity
  Returns :      new GtkTextMark
  

==== GetType ====
''GetType() : [[..:..:Gtk:GObject:Type#T|Gtk.GObject.Type.T]]''
