**** Note ****
This widget is considered too specialized/little-used for GTK+, and will in the
future be moved to some other package. If your application needs this widget,
feel free to use it, as the widget does work and is useful in some
applications; it's just not of general interest. However, we are not accepting
new features for the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+
