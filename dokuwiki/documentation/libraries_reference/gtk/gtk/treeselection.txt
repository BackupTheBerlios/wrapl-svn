  The GtkTreeSelection object is a helper object to manage the selection for a GtkTreeView widget. The
  GtkTreeSelection object is automatically created when a new GtkTreeView widget is created, and
  cannot exist independentally of this widget. The primary reason the GtkTreeSelection objects exists
  is for cleanliness of code and API. That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could
  not be methods on the GtkTreeView widget instead of a separate function.
  The GtkTreeSelection object is gotten from a GtkTreeView by calling gtk_tree_view_get_selection().
  It can be manipulated to check the selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect
  individual rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result, multiple views of the same
  model can have completely different selections. Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a
  row on the model that is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents first.
  One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of a view is that the
  "changed" signal is mostly a hint. That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is
  selected. Additionally, it may on occasion emit a ::changed signal when nothing has happened (mostly
  as a result of programmers calling select_row on an already selected row).

==== :GetMode ====
'':GetMode(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Gtk:Gtk:SelectionMode#T|Gtk.Gtk.SelectionMode.T]]''

  Gets the selection mode for selection. See gtk_tree_selection_set_mode().
  
  selection : a GtkTreeSelection

==== :GetSelected ====
'':GetSelected(self @ [[#T|T]], model @ [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]], iter @ [[..:..:Gtk:Gtk:TreeIter#T|Gtk.Gtk.TreeIter.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Symbol#T|Std.Symbol.T]]''

  Sets iter to the currently selected node if selection is set to GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE or GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE. iter may
  be NULL if you just want to test if selection has any selected nodes. model is filled with the current model as a
  convenience. This function will not work if you use selection is GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE.
  
  selection : A GtkTreeSelection.
  model :     A pointer to set to the GtkTreeModel, or NULL.
  iter :      The GtkTreeIter, or NULL.

  function, you may want to convert the returned list into a list of GtkTreeRowReferences. To do this, you can use
  gtk_tree_row_reference_new().
  To free the return value, use:
  g_list_foreach (list, gtk_tree_path_free, NULL);
  g_list_free (list);
