  A GtkTearoffMenuItem is a special GtkMenuItem which is used to tear off and
  reattach its menu.
  When its menu is shown normally, the GtkTearoffMenuItem is drawn as a dotted
  line indicating that the menu can be torn off. Activating it causes its menu to
  be torn off and displayed in its own window as a tearoff menu.
  When its menu is shown as a tearoff menu, the GtkTearoffMenuItem is drawn as a
  dotted line which has a left pointing arrow graphic indicating that the tearoff
  menu can be reattached. Activating it will erase the tearoff menu window.
