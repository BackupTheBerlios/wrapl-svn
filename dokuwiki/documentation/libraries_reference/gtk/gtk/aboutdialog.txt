The GtkAboutDialog offers a simple way to display information about a program
like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is also possible to
give credits to the authors, documenters, translators and artists who have
worked on the program. An about dialog is typically opened when the user
selects the About option from the Help menu. All parts of the dialog are
optional.
About dialog often contain links and email addresses. GtkAboutDialog supports
this by offering global hooks, which are called when the user clicks on a link
or email address, see gtk_about_dialog_set_email_hook() and
gtk_about_dialog_set_url_hook(). Email addresses in the authors, documenters
and artists properties are recognized by looking for <user@host>, URLs are
recognized by looking for http://url, with url extending to the next space, tab
or line break.
To make constructing a GtkAboutDialog as convenient as possible, you can use
the function gtk_show_about_dialog() which constructs and shows a dialog and
keeps it around so that it can be shown again.
Note that GTK+ sets a default title of _("About %s") on the dialog window
(where %s is replaced by the name of the application, but in order to ensure
proper translation of the title, applications should set the title property
explicitly when constructing a GtkAboutDialog, as shown in the following
example:
gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                       "name", "ExampleCode",
                       "logo", example_logo,
                       "title" _("About ExampleCode"),
                       NULL);

==== :SetTranslatorCredits ====

Sets the translator credits string which is displayed in the translators tab of
the secondary credits dialog.
The intended use for this string is to display the translator of the language
which is currently used in the user interface. Using gettext(), a simple way to
achieve that is to mark the string for translation:
 gtk_about_dialog_set_translator_credits (about, _("translator-credits"));
It is a good idea to use the customary msgid "translator-credits" for this
purpose, since translators will already know the purpose of that msgid, and
since GtkAboutDialog will detect if "translator-credits" is untranslated and
hide the tab.

translator_credits : the translator credits
