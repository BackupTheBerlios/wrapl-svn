  The GtkBin widget is a container with just one child. It is not very useful itself, but it is useful
  for deriving subclasses, since it provides common code needed for handling a single child widget.
  Many GTK+ widgets are subclasses of GtkBin, including GtkWindow, GtkButton, GtkFrame, GtkHandleBox,
  and GtkScrolledWindow.
  

==== :GetChild ====
'':GetChild(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Gtk:Gtk:Widget#T|Gtk.Gtk.Widget.T]]''

  Gets the child of the GtkBin, or NULL if the bin contains no child widget. The returned widget does not have a reference
  added, so you do not need to unref it.
  
  bin :     a GtkBin
  Returns : pointer to child of the GtkBin
  

==== :Child ====
'':Child(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Gtk:Gtk:Widget#T|Gtk.Gtk.Widget.T]]''

  Gets the child of the GtkBin, or NULL if the bin contains no child widget. The returned widget does not have a reference
  added, so you do not need to unref it.
  
  bin :     a GtkBin
  Returns : pointer to child of the GtkBin
  

==== GetType ====
''GetType() : [[..:..:Gtk:GObject:Type#T|Gtk.GObject.Type.T]]''
