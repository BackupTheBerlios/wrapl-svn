====== CellEditable ======
==== T ====

The GtkCellEditable interface must be implemented for widgets to be usable when
editing the contents of a GtkTreeView cell.

==== :StartEditing ====
'':StartEditing(self @ [[#T|T]], event @ [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

Begins editing on a cell_editable. event is the GdkEvent that began the editing
process. It may be NULL, in the instance that editing was initiated through
programatic means.
cell_editable : A GtkCellEditable
event :         A GdkEvent, or NULL

==== :EditingDone ====
'':EditingDone(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

Emits the "editing-done" signal.
cell_editable : A GtkTreeEditable

==== :RemoveWidget ====
'':RemoveWidget(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

Emits the "remove-widget" signal.
cell_editable : A GtkTreeEditable
***** Signal Details *****
The "editing-done" signal
void                user_function                      (GtkCellEditable
*cell_editable,
                                                        gpointer
user_data)          : Run Last
This signal is a sign for the cell renderer to update its value from the
cell_editable.
Implementations of GtkCellEditable are responsible for emitting this signal
when they are done editing, e.g. GtkEntry is emitting it when the user presses
Enter.
gtk_cell_editable_editing_done() is a convenience method for emitting ::
editing-done.
cell_editable : the object on which the signal was emitted
user_data :     user data set when the signal handler was connected.

==== GetType ====
''GetType() : [[..:..:Gtk:GObject:Type#T|Gtk.GObject.Type.T]]''
