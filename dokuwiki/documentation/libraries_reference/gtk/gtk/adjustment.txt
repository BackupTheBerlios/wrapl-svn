  The GtkAdjustment object represents a value which has an associated lower and upper bound, together
  with step and page increments, and a page size. It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including
  GtkSpinButton, GtkViewport, and GtkRange (which is a base class for GtkHScrollbar, GtkVScrollbar,
  GtkHScale, and GtkVScale).
  The GtkAdjustment object does not update the value itself. Instead it is left up to the owner of the
  GtkAdjustment to control the value.
  The owner of the GtkAdjustment typically calls the gtk_adjustment_value_changed() and
  gtk_adjustment_changed() functions after changing the value and its bounds. This results in the
  emission of the "value_changed" or "changed" signal respectively.
  

==== :ValueChanged ====
'':ValueChanged(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

  Emits a "value_changed" signal from the GtkAdjustment. This is typically called by the owner of the GtkAdjustment after
  it has changed the GtkAdjustment value field.
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment
  

==== :SetValue ====
'':SetValue(self @ [[#T|T]], value @ [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

  Sets the GtkAdjustment value. The value is clamped to lie between adjustment->lower and adjustment->upper.
  Note that for adjustments which are used in a GtkScrollbar, the effective range of allowed values goes from adjustment-
  >lower to adjustment->upper - adjustment->page_size.
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment.
  value :      the new value.
  

==== :Lower ====
'':Lower(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''


==== :Upper ====
'':Upper(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''


==== :Value ====
'':Value(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''

  Gets the current value of the adjustment. See gtk_adjustment_set_value().
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment
  Returns :    The current value of the adjustment.

  value :      the new value.
  

==== :StepIncrement ====
'':StepIncrement(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''


==== :PageIncrement ====
'':PageIncrement(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''


==== :PageSize ====
'':PageSize(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''


==== :Changed ====
'':Changed(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

  Emits a "changed" signal from the GtkAdjustment. This is typically called by the owner of the GtkAdjustment after it has
  changed any of the GtkAdjustment fields other than the value.
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment
  

==== :ClampPage ====
'':ClampPage(self @ [[#T|T]], lower @ [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], upper @ [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

  Updates the GtkAdjustment value to ensure that the range between lower and upper is in the current page (i.e. between
  value and value + page_size). If the range is larger than the page size, then only the start of it will be in the
  current page. A "changed" signal will be emitted if the value is changed.
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment.
  lower :      the lower value.
  upper :      the upper value.
  

==== :GetValue ====
'':GetValue(self @ [[#T|T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]''

  Gets the current value of the adjustment. See gtk_adjustment_set_value().
  
  adjustment : a GtkAdjustment
  Returns :    The current value of the adjustment.
  

==== New ====
''New(value : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], lower : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], upper : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], step_increment : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], page_increment : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]], page_size : [[..:..:Std:Real#T|Std.Real.T]]) : [[# T| T]]''

  Creates a new GtkAdjustment.
  
  value :          the initial value.
  lower :          the minimum value.
  upper :          the maximum value.
  step_increment : the step increment.
  page_increment : the page increment.
  page_size :      the page size.
  Returns :        a new GtkAdjustment.
  

==== GetType ====
''GetType() : [[..:..:Gtk:GObject:Type#T|Gtk.GObject.Type.T]]''
