  access the popup_data while the menu is posted via gtk_item_factory_popup_data
  () and gtk_item_factory_popup_data_from_widget().

  menu popup. If the menu popup was initiated by something other than a mouse
  button press, such as a mouse button release or a keypress, mouse_button should
  be 0.

  popup. If such an event is not available, use gtk_get_current_event_time()
  instead.
