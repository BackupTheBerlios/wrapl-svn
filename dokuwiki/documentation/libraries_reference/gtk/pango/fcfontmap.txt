PangoFcFontMap is a base class for font map implementations using the
Fontconfig and FreeType libraries. It is used in the Xft and FreeType backends
shipped with Pango, but can also be used when creating new backends. Any
backend deriving from this base class will take advantage of the wide range of
shapers implemented using FreeType that come with Pango.

==== :AddDecoderFindFunc ====
'':AddDecoderFindFunc(self @ [[#T|T]], findfunc @ [[..:..:Std:Function#T|Std.Function.T]], user_data @ [[..:..:Std:Address#T|Std.Address.T]], dnotify @ [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]) : [[..:..:Std:Object#T|Std.Object.T]]''

This function saves a callback method in the PangoFcFontMap that will be called
whenever new fonts are created. If the function returns a PangoFcDecoder, that
decoder will be used to determine both coverage via a FcCharSet and a one-to-
one mapping of characters to glyphs. This will allow applications to have
application-specific encodings for various fonts.
fcfontmap : The PangoFcFontMap to add this method to.
findfunc :  The PangoFcDecoderFindFunc callback function
user_data : User data.
dnotify :   A GDestroyNotify callback that will be called when the fontmap is
            finalized and the decoder is released.
Since 1.6.
