====== Symbol ======
===== Overview =====
''Std.Symbol'' provides the symbol type, which are used as multimethods.

===== Exports =====

==== T ====
Instances of ''Std.Symbol.T'' are called symbols. They are essential multimethods; type/value signatures can be added to a symbol with corresponding functions. When invoked, a symbol will first find its closest matching signature to the current arguments and then call the corresponding function with those arguments.

==== New() ====
Returns a new symbol.

==== In ====
Used for adding signatures using ''[[.Symbol#Set]]''. Specifies that in order to match the signature, the corresponding argument must be in the following type.

==== Is ====
Used for adding signatures using ''[[.Symbol#Set]]''. Specifies that in order to match the signature, the corresponding argument must be the following value.

==== Set(symbol, function, {In, type | Is, value | NIL, NIL}) ====
Adds a new signature to ''symbol'' with corresponding function ''function''. Two arguments are required for each argument in the signature. ''In, type'' denotes a type match. ''Is, value'' denotes a value match. ''NIL, NIL'' matches any argument. This function is automatically called by a ''TO ...'' expression, see [[..:..:Tutorial#Multiple Dispatch]].
