====== Integer ======
===== Overview =====
''Std.Integer'' provides the basic integer type, actual integers are instances of one of two different integer types, depending on whether they fit into a single machine word or not. However, all arithmetic functions will work on both types and produce a result of the correct type automatically.

===== Exports =====
==== T ====
''Std.Integer.T'' is an abstract type representing the base type of all integers.

==== SmallT ====
Instances of ''Std.Integer.SmallT'' are integers small enough to fit into a single signed machine word.

==== BigT ====
Instances of ''Std.Integer.BigT'' are integers of arbitrary precision which are too large to fit into a single signed machine word. Note that it is not allowed to have an instance of ''Std.Integer.BigT'' with a value which can fit in a single signed machine word.
